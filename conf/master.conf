# Configuration for a Visage master.

# The debug modes to activate. Valid entries:
# - slave: Include an X-Visage-Slave header containing the name of the
#          slave that serviced this request.
# - cache: Include an X-Visage-Cache-Miss header containing a list of
#          things that could not be retrieved from the cache, or the string
#          'none' if everything was served from the cache.
# - error: When an error occurs, serve up a raw stack trace instead of a
#          generic error page.
# Invalid entries are ignored.
debug: ["slave", "cache", "error"]

# What to expose in the headers. Valid entries:
# - server: Include the X-Powered-By header.
# - version: Append the Visage version to the X-Powered-By header.
# Invalid entries are ignored.
expose: ["server", "version"]

# Which modes to allow requests for. Valid entries:
# - face: 2D renders consisting of just the front of the head.
# - head: 3D renders of the entire head and helm.
# - portrait: 3D renders of the head, arms, and torso.
# - player: 3D renders of the entire player.
# - skin: The player's skin, including internal format modifications by Visage.
# Invalid entries are ignored.
modes: ["face", "head", "portrait", "player", "skin"]

# Which parameters to allow requests to set. Valid entries:
# - yaw (float): The degrees of rotation to apply on the Y axis.
# - pitch (float): The degrees of rotation to apply on the X axis.
# - roll (float): The degrees of rotation to apply on the Z axis. Looks
#         rather silly and has no real use, so it is disabled by default.
# - shadow (boolean): Whether or not to render the shadow underneath
#                     the player.
# - hat (boolean): Whether or not to include the second head layer.
# - lsleeve (boolean): Whether or not to include the second left arm layer.
# - rsleeve (boolean): Whether or not to include the second right arm layer.
# - lpant (boolean): Whether or not to include the second left leg layer.
# - rpant (boolean): Whether or not to include the second right leg layer.
# - cape (boolean): Whether or not to include the player's cape, if present.
# Invalid entries are ignored.
